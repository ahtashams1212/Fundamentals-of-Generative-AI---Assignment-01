Artificial Intelligence (AI):

Definition: AI refers to the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. It encompasses any algorithm, system, or machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.
Scope: AI includes a wide range of technologies from basic calculators to complex systems that can understand speech or beat the best human players in strategic games like chess or Go.
Machine Learning (ML):

Definition: Machine learning is a subset of AI that includes algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Machine learning systems automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed for every task.
Scope: Machine learning covers various methods like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. It is used in applications ranging from email filtering to recommendation systems.
Deep Learning (DL):

Definition: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised.
Scope: Deep learning has been particularly successful in tasks that involve recognizing patterns from unstructured data like images and audio. Applications include voice recognition systems like Siri and Alexa, image recognition, and autonomous driving.
Generative AI:

Definition: Generative AI refers to a type of AI that can generate content such as text, images, music, and more by learning from existing data. It includes technologies like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformer models used in natural language processing.
Scope: Applications of generative AI include creating new artworks, generating realistic human voices, synthesizing novel chemical molecules for drugs, and more.
Applied AI:

Definition: Applied AI refers to the application of artificial intelligence technologies to solve real-world problems. It involves the practical implementation of AI to achieve concrete outcomes and can encompass both specialized and generalized forms of AI.
Scope: Applied AI is used across various industries including healthcare (for diagnostic systems), finance (for fraud detection and robo-advisors), automotive (for self-driving cars), and more.
